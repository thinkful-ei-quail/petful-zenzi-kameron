# Petful Server
Developers: Kameron Masullo and Zenzi Ali
This API allows the user to request pet data stored for our Petful client application.  A user has the ability to view all potential pets.  The user can also sign up to become an adoptive pet owner via our landing page.  Potential owners are placed in queue and given the opportunity to adopt the next available pet.  A potential adoptive owner can choose the cat or dog currently available for adoption.  Choosing a pet removes said pet from our inventory and repopulates our "available for adoption" page with the next waiting pet in queue. This API holds the endpoints for populating the next available pet page, adopting a pet (deleting it from our stock), registering as a adopter (posting to our user queue), and updating the next available pet after a successful adoption.

This project uses Node.js, React.js (client-side), PostgreSQL, and JavaScript.

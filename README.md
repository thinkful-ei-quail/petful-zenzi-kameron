Petful is an app that allows users to adopt cats and dogs after creating an account name. Users may only adopt the cat or dog that has been housed by our organization the longest. Users may view all our entire inventory of pets and see details about each cat or dog. Select the adopt button when you are 1st in our waiting list.

This API provides server side support for the app. It provides endpoints for adding/creating new users to the waiting list and deleting users after the adoption cycle. It also provide endpoints for deleting cats and dogs after adoption, viewing all dogs and cats, or viewing the current cat/dog in need of adoption.

This project uses Node.js, React.js (client-side)Express, and JavaScript. The project also relies on JavaScript Queue structure with JS algorithms for creating CRUD requests.
